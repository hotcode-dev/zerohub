## What is ZeroHub?

ZeroHub is an open-source WebRTC signaling server that provides a simple way to build peer-to-peer (P2P) applications.

By offering an intuitive interface to the WebRTC protocol, ZeroHub simplifies the development process for P2P projects, allowing developers to focus on creating innovative real-time communication solutions.

## Features

- Multipeers WebRTC signaling server
- Signaling over WebSockets (RFC6455) or WebTransport
- TypeScript/JavaScript client SDK
- Peer Metadata for customize use cases
- Automatic transfer Session Description Protocol (SDP)
- Zero-downtime strategies
- Scalable architecture supporting high concurrency

## What is WebRTC?

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is an open-source project that enables real-time communication of audio, video, and data directly between browsers and devices without requiring plugins or external software. It is designed to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) connections, allowing devices to communicate directly without relying on a central server for data transmission.

## What is WebRTC signaling server?

A WebRTC signaling server facilitates the initial connection between peers in WebRTC applications. It helps exchange metadata like network information and media capabilities before establishing a direct peer-to-peer connection. Once this connection is established, data flows directly between peers without passing through the server, enabling efficient real-time communication.
